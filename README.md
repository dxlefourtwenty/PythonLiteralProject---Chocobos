- NFA accepting Python-Literal decimal integers; debugging
  
- Aided with JFlap designs

- Created Test Cases

- Combined all NFAs into one NFA in main branch to accept decimal integer, hexadecimal integer, octal integer, and floating point literal strings (Tasks 1, 2, & 3).


Derek Mori

- Designed the NFAs for recognizing Python decimal integers, hexadecimal integers, octal integers, and floating point literals

- Combined NFAs to recognize multiple types of integers at the same time

- Aided in debugging the program and ensuring that the output was correct

- Ran test cases on JFLAP to compare with the output of the program


-About Repository-

main contains the Java program and JFLAP file for an NFA that accepts all Python decimal, hexadecimal, and octal integers, and floating point literals. (Tasks 1, 2, & 3)

FloatingPT_Branch contains the Java program and JFLAP file for an NFA that only accepts Python floating point literals. (Task 3)

Decimal_Oct_Hex_Branch contains the Java program and JFLAP file for an NFA that accepts Python decimal, hexadecimal, and octal integers. (Task 2)

Decimal_Branch contains the Java program and JFLAP file for an NFA that opnly accepts Python decimal integers. (Task 1)

To test strings in any of the programs, input a .txt file (could be in the same directory for ease) that contains a string in each line to test. Results will be outputted into an 'output.txt' file.
